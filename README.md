# Seeing Box

Point the Seeing Box, push the button, and it will tell you what it sees. This fun project can be built over a few days and has a practical side for the vision impaired. It uses Microsoft Cognitive Services API, and hence, requires an internet connection.  Yes, "there is an app for that," but the form factor is much cooler and the cost less than a smartphone as it is based on the $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W. Enjoy‚ù§
